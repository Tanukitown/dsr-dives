# DSR Practice Tool

This tool provides an interactive timeline to walk you through a phase step by step. As mechanics resolve, you will have to have place each party member in the correct position, or you will fail and have to start over.

## How to Use

* Move role icons by clicking them, then dragging
* Rotate icons by clicking them, then drag the top line
* Once you believe icons are in the correct position; click `Next Step` to proceed to the next step in the timeline
* If you were successful; move the icons to the correct positions for the next mechanic
* If you failed; you will get a popup with an example of how to correctly solve the step
